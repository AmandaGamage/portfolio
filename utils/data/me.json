However, the only sport I actually played was Table Tennis. I started playing Table Tennis when I was 6 years old. There were many times that I fell out of love for the game, but my parents' enthusiasm to see me play kept me going. However, after moving to South Korea, I have not had the opportunity to play Table Tennis for the last two years, mainly due to a knee injury I suffered while playing for the university Table Tennis team in Sri Lanka. In case you are interested, here is a boring list of my Table Tennis achievements."

                                            "Books, music, and movies have always been a big influence on me. Though I read anything and everything, ranging from “The Name of the Wind” by Patrick Rothfuss, to “Sapiens:A Brief History of Humankind” by Yuval Noah Hararri I have a soft spot for fantasy. I first fell in love with the genre with “Harry Potter” by J.K.Rowling when I was 11 years old. Since then I spend a lot of my free time reading books belonging to a multitude of genres. I also enjoy listening to music and watching movies. I am a big fan of sci-fi movies and dramas like “The Expanse” and “Black Mirror”. I have also started to enjoy K-dramas and K-pop music since moving to South Korea. This has helped me become fluent or at least understand Korean to a certain extent. It is always hard to list out favorites, but just because I want to list out something in this section, here’s a list of some quotes that I find compelling, mostly taken from books and k-dramas."
