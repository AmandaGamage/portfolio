The developed system consists of several features including automatic journey detection, freedom to use any smartphone in any position with or without an active internet connection when collecting data, converging values collected from different sources, and visualizing them in a virtual map. This project was carried out in collaboration with the Road Development Authority, Sri Lanka, under the supervision of Dr. Adeesha Wijayasiri."
